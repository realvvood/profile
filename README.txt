/// Welcome to the README for my page! ///

Uhh . . . there's like nothing here. I don't know why you wanted to read it.
This is just the source code for my personal profile page, so it's not really helpful to anyone.

Oh, I suppose the file is named quite enticingly! Of course you'd want to read one with such a bold name.
Whatever, scram - this is just a standard code repository.
